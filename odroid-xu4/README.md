
# Tensorflow on Odroid XU4 (Unastable)

### To build Tensorflow on Odroid XU4, we will need following hardware.

- Odroid XU4 board
- SD Card / eMMC
- Network cable
- USB (Swap memory)
- Monitor (Optional)
- Keyboard and Mouse (Optional)

<img src = 'images/Hardware.jpeg' height = '320px'>
</p>

### Step 1: Format SD Card
We need to format SD card because without formatting it, we may not get all available space for OS. I am using software available on https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/eula_mac/
<p align = 'center'>
<img src = 'images/SDCardFormatter.png' height = '320px'>
</p>

### Step 2: Download OS for Odroid XU4
We can download OS from https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c1/os_images/ubuntu/v3.0 (https://east.us.odroid.in/ubuntu_18.04lts/ubuntu-18.04-4.14-mate-odroid-xu4-20180501.img.xz)

### Step 3: Load OS on SD Card
We will use <b>Balena Etcher</b> to load OS image on SD Card. Balena Etcher is available on http://etcher.io

### Step 4: Let's get into the Odroid using SSH
<p align = 'center'>
<img src = 'images/ssh.png' height = '320px'>
</p>

### Step 5: Execute some basic commands required for Odroid XU4
```
sudo apt install libnfs11
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
```

### Step 6.1: Preprocessing for Bazel (Build tool for Tensorflow)
Before we build Bazel, run following commands
```
sudo apt-get install pkg-config zip g++ zlib1g-dev unzip default-jdk autoconf automake libtool

# For Python 2.7
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-numpy swig python-dev
sudo pip install wheel

# For Python 3.3+
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-numpy swig python3-dev
sudo pip3 install wheel
```
We will use gcc and g++ version 4.8 to build bazel
```
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 100
```
Check gcc and g++ versions before proceeding further.
```
odroid@odroid:~$ gcc --version

odroid@odroid:~$ g++ --version
g++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.8.5-4ubuntu8) 4.8.5
Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

```
To build Bazel, we need JDK 8. Odroid Ubuntu Mate comes with JDK 10. We need to first uninstall it.
```
sudo apt purge openjdk-*
```
Install JDK 8
```
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
```
Check java and javac version.
```
odroid@odroid:~/Desktop$ javac -version
javac 1.8.0_191
odroid@odroid:~/Desktop$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_191"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_191-8u191-b12-0ubuntu0.18.04.1-b12)
OpenJDK Client VM (build 25.191-b12, mixed mode)
```

### Step 6.2: Adding swap memory
Install htop to check swap memory attached with Odroid
```
sudo apt install htop
```
First, put insert your USB drive, and find the /dev/XXX path for the device.
```
sudo blkid
```
As an example, my drive's path was /dev/sda1

Flag your device to be swap:
```
sudo mkswap /dev/XXX
```
Copy the UUID associated with /dev/XXX
Now edit your /etc/fstab file to register your swap file.
```
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
On a separate line, enter the following information. Replace the X's with the UUID (without quotes)
```
UUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX none swap sw,pri=5 0 0
```
Save /etc/fstab, exit your text editor, and run the following command:
```
sudo swapon -a
```
Ok, we have added swap memory. To check run <b>htop</b>. In <b>Swp</b>, you should now have some memory size.

### Step 6.3: Get Bazel
```
wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.15.0/bazel-0.15.0-dist.zip
unzip -d bazel bazel-0.15.0-dist.zip
```
Once it's done downloading and extracting, we can move into the directory to make a few changes:
```
cd bazel
sudo chmod u+w ./* -R
```
We need to update Java heap size before building bazel. Edit scripts/bootstrap/compile.sh
```
nano scripts/bootstrap/compile.sh
```
Update
```
  run "${JAVAC}" -classpath "${classpath}" -sourcepath "${sourcepath}" \
      -d "${output}/classes" -source "$JAVA_VERSION" -target "$JAVA_VERSION" \
      -encoding UTF-8 "@${paramfile}"
```
To
```
  run "${JAVAC}" -classpath "${classpath}" -sourcepath "${sourcepath}" \
      -d "${output}/classes" -source "$JAVA_VERSION" -target "$JAVA_VERSION" \
      -encoding UTF-8 "@${paramfile}" -J-Xmx500M
```
Save file and exit. 

### Step 6.4: Build Bazel (~35 Minutes)
```
./compile.sh
```
After build finishes, run following command
```
sudo cp output/bazel /usr/local/bin/bazel
```
To make sure it's working properly, run ```bazel``` on the command line and verify it prints help text. Note: this may take 5-10 seconds to run, so be patient!
```

```
Let's start building. <b>It will take really long time. (~5 hours, 30 minutes)</b>
```
bazel build -c opt --jobs 3 --local_resources 1024,6,1 \
--copt=-mfpu=neon-vfpv4 --copt=-ftree-vectorize \
--copt=-funsafe-math-optimizations \
--copt=-ftree-loop-vectorize \
--copt=-fomit-frame-pointer \
--copt=-DRASPBERRY_PI --host_copt=-DRASPBERRY_PI \
--verbose_failures //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
```
After it finishes
```
INFO: Elapsed time: 18853.011s, Critical Path: 1240.91s
INFO: 5700 processes: 5700 local.
INFO: Build completed successfully, 6337 total actions
```
Let's create wheel file
```
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
```
Install it
```
sudo pip3 install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.11.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_armv7l.whl
```

WARNING: With above steps, Tensorflow works fine with Keras but gives ```BUS ERROR``` when used directly. Possible reason for error is memory mis-alignment.

RECOMMENDATION: Use steps below for stable version.

# Tensorflow on Odroid XU4 (Stable)
Download tensorflow from official <b>piwheels</b> website
```
wget https://www.piwheels.org/simple/tensorflow/tensorflow-1.11.0-cp35-none-linux_armv7l.whl
```
This package is compiled using Python3.5. If we try to install it for Python3.6, we will get following error:
```
```
Now we have 2 options. Either we unistall Python3.6 and install Python3.5 or we force wheel file to be installed for Python3.6.

### OPTION 1: Install above whl using Python3.6
After download, rename file tensorflow-1.11.0-cp35-none-linux_armv7l.whl > tensorflow-1.11.0-cp36-none-linux_armv7l.whl
```
mv tensorflow-1.11.0-cp35-none-linux_armv7l.whl tensorflow-1.11.0-cp36-none-linux_armv7l.whl
```
Install Tensorflow
```
sudo python3 -m pip install tensorflow-1.11.0-cp36-none-linux_armv7l.whl
```
